## Court Eviction Filings Scraper

### Problem:

In one of work projects, we tried to estimate impact of federal rent assistance (ERA) program on eviction filing rates in Cincinnati, OH. 
The ERA program was launched in the begining of Covid-19 and it provided rent assistance dollars to qualifying renters in an effort to 
stabilize their financial situation and prevent eviction. Thus, the hypothesis was that the ERA program should reduce eviction filings 
in the city. However, there was no eviction filing data readily available.
